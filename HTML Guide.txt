      --------------------------/\/\/\/\/\/\--------------------------

All pages should begin with <!DOCTYPE html>. This special string is known as a declaration and ensures the browser tries to meet industry-wide specifications.

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html lang="en">

Languaje is declared in the openning html tag <html lang="en">

You can set browser behavior by adding self-closing meta elements in the head. Here's an example: <meta attribute="value"> Note that meta elements are self-closing.

Tell the browser to parse the markup into multiple languages by creating a meta element as a child of the head element. Set its [charset] attribute to UTF-8.



-------------------------------------////-----------------------------------------


Now you need to link the styles.css file so the styles will be applied again. Nest a self-closing link element in the head element. Give it a rel attribute value stylesheet and an href attribute value of styles.css.


<!DOCTYPE html> 
		[siempre just "html5"]
<html lang="en"> 

		[set the page languaje]


<head> [all config that are not to be "rendered"]

    <meta charset="utf-8" /> 

		[charset to be used -- this one have the puntuation mark]

    <title>Cafe Menu</title> 
		
		[txt that is displayed in the browser tab]


    <link>    [https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_link.asp] <selfclosing>

		

		The <link> tag defines the relationship between the current document
 		and an external resource.

		The <link> tag is most often used to link to external style sheets
		or to add a favicon to your website.

		The <link> element is an empty element, it contains attributes only.
		-crossorigin
		*anonymous use-credentials
		+Specifies how the element handles cross-origin requests

	-href
		*URL
			+Specifies the location of the linked document


				<link rel="value">	

				[rel] atribute Required. Specifies the relationship 					between	the current document and the linked document

</head>

        -------------------------------/////---------------------------

	For the styling of the page to look similar on mobile as it does on a 			desktop or laptop, you need to add a [meta] element with a special content 		attribute.

	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />


				

<article></article>

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article

Itâ€™s looking good. Time to start adding some menu items. Add an empty article element under the Coffee heading. It will contain a flavor and price of each coffee you currently offer.

	The <article> HTML element represents a self-contained composition in a 		document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently 		distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum 		post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry, a product card, a 		user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other 		independent item of content.

*----------------------

The <figure> HTML element represents self-contained content, potentially with an optional caption, which is specified using the <figcaption> element. The figure, its caption, and its contents are referenced as a single unit.
*

------------------------------------------------

"Gosth" margins in elements [html structure afects they way elements are rendered]

You could keep trying various percentages for the widths. Instead, use the back space key on your keyboard to move the p element with the class price next to the p element with the class flavor so that they are on the same line in the editor. Make sure there is no space between them.


Inside the footer, add a p element. Then, nest an anchor (a) element in the p that links to https://www.freecodecamp.org and has the text Visit our website.


 	<footer>
        	<p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">Visit our website</a></p>
	</footer>


-----

The <hr> element represents a paragraph-level thematic break, e.g. a scene change in a story, or a transition to another topic within a section of a reference book.

https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_hr.asp

You can use an hr element to display a divider between sections of different content.

First, add an hr element between the p element with the class established and the first section element. Note that hr elements are self closing.


Focusing on the menu items and prices, there is a fairly large gap between each line.

Target all the p elements nested in elements with the class named item and set their top and bottom margin to be 5px.


You change properties of a link when the link has actually been visited by using a pseudo-selector that looks like a:visited { propertyName: propertyValue; }.

Change the color of the footer Visit our website link to be grey when a user has visited the link.

You change properties of a link when the mouse hovers over them by using a pseudo-selector that looks like a:hover { propertyName: propertyValue; }.

Change the color of the footer Visit our website link to be brown when a user hovers over it.

You change properties of a link when the link is actually being clicked by using a pseudo-selector that looks like a:active { propertyName: propertyValue; }.

Change the color of the footer Visit our website link to be white when clicked on.



The menu text CAMPER CAFE has a different space from the top than the address's space at the bottom of the menu. This is due to the browser having some default top margin for the h1 element.

Change the top margin of the h1 element to 0 to remove all the top margin.

Definition and Usage

The <fieldset> tag is used to group related elements in a form.

The <fieldset> tag draws a box around the related elements.

Tips and Notes
Tip: The <legend> tag is used to define a caption for the <fieldset> element.



Attribute	Value		Description

disabled	disabled	Specifies that a group of related form elements should be disabled
form		form_id		Specifies which form the fieldset belongs to
name		text		Specifies a name for the fieldset



As the form will have three distinct sections, add three fieldset elements within the form element.

--------------------------------------------\/\/\/\//\/\/\/--------------------------------------


	<form method="post" action='https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org'>

	  </fieldset>
      	
	  <fieldset>
      	  </fieldset>
	</form>


The first fieldset will hold name, email, and password fields. 

Start by adding four label elements to the first fieldset.

        <label>Enter Your Email: <input></label>
        <label>Create a New Password: <input></label>
      </fieldset>

Step 18
Following accessibility best practices, link the input elements and the label elements together using the for attribute.

Use first-name, last-name, email, and new-password as values for the respective id attributes.


<fieldset>
  <label for="first-name">Enter Your First Name: <input id="first-name"/>
  </label>

  <label for="last-name">Enter Your Last Name: <input id="last-name"/>
  </label>
        
  <label for="email">Enter Your Email: <input id="email"/></label>
  <label for="new-password">Create a New Password: <input id="new-password" /></label>
      </fieldset>

**********************/\/\/\//\
<label></label> label elements are used to help associate the text [in this case [Indoor] for an input element with the input element itself [in this case the radio button]

	<label>
		<input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor
	</label>
**********************/\/\/\//\


Step 19

Specifying the type attribute of a form element is important for the browser to know what kind of data it should expect. If the type is not specified, the browser will default to text.

ie:   <input type="text" id="first-name">

Give the first two input elements a type attribute of text, the third a type attribute of email, and the fourth a type attribute of password.

The email type only allows emails with a @ and a . in the domain. The password type obscures the input, and warns if the site does not use HTTPS.


At this point, you should be able to submit the form. However, you might notice not much happens.

To make the form more interactive, add the required attribute to the input elements in the first fieldset.

Now, if you try to submit the form without filling in the required fields, you will see an error message.

Label tag is there so when you select the display text [ie Indoor] the option will be selected


Step 20Passed

The first input element with a type of submit is automatically set to submit its nearest parent form element.

To handle the form submission, after the last fieldset element add an input element with the type attribute set to submit and the value attribute set to Submit.


<input type="submit value="Submit">



At this point, you should be able to submit the form. However, you might notice not much happens.

To make the form more interactive, add the required attribute to the input elements in the first fieldset.

Now, if you try to submit the form without filling in the required fields, you will see an error message.



				----------------------------------
----------------------------------Step 22 ------input validation---------------------------
				----------------------------------

Certain type attribute values come with built-in form validation. For example, type="email" requires that the value be a valid email address.

Add custom validation to the password input element, by adding a [minlength] attribute with a value of 8. Doing so prevents inputs of less than 8 characters being submitted.

Step 23Passed
With type="password" you can use the pattern attribute to define a regular expression that the password must match to be considered valid.

Add a pattern attribute to the password input element to require the input match: [a-z0-5]{8,}

The above is a regular expression which matches eight or more lowercase letters or the digits 0 to 5. Then, remove the minlength attribute, and try it out.

another way to associate an input element's text with the element itself. You can nest the text within a label element and add a for attribute with the same value as the input element's id attribute.

	<input id="loving" type="checkbox">
	<label for="loving">Loving</label>

In the above example you would have the label [text] beneat the input checkbox.
you can also nest the <input> and they will behave as inline elements.

Let us go to the next part of the registration form. This section will ask for the type of account the user is opening, and will confirm the user has read the terms and conditions.


Users will be allowed to choose either a Personal Account or Business Account.
To do this, within each of the first two label elements, add one input element with type="radio".

There's another way to associate an input element's 
text with the element itself. You can nest the text 
within a label element and add a for attribute with 
the same value as the input element's id attribute.

   </label>
   <label>
     <input type="radio" />
   </label>
   <label></label>
 </fieldset>

Step 26
For the terms and conditions, add an input with a type of checkbox to the third label element. Make this input element required because users should not sign up without reading the terms and conditions.


        <label>
          <input type="checkbox" required>
        </label>

Step 27
Within each corresponding label element, and immediately after the input element, add a space and add the following text:

Personal Account
Business Account
I accept the terms and conditions

 <fieldset>
   <label>
     <input type="radio" /> Personal Account 
   </label>
   <label>
     <input type="radio" /> Business Account

-------------------
Notice that both radio buttons can be selected at the same time. To make it so selecting one radio button automatically deselects the other, both buttons must have a name attribute with the same value.

	|-----------------------------------////\\\\---------------------------------|
          name attribute synt==<input type="submit" id="XXX" name="xxx" required>
	|-----------------------------------////\\\\---------------------------------|


You only want one radio input to be selectable at a time. However, the form does not know the radio inputs are related.

*********************************************************************************
* In order to make a checkbox "checked" or radio button selected by default	*
*										*
* add the checked attribute to it. No need to set a value to the attribute. 	*

*********************************************************************************


				//////\\\\\
------------------------------[name] attribute-------------------------------
				\\\\\\/////


Add the [name] attribute with the value "account-type" to the checkbox [input] element.

While you won't notice this in the browser, doing this makes it easier for a server to process your web form, especially when there are multiple checkboxes.


*********************************************

   </label>
   <label>
	<input type="checkbox" required /> I accept the terms and conditions

By adding the same name to multiple checkboxes/radio buttons makes it so you can only have one selected at any time. [when user select one opt the rest get unchecked]

*/*/*/*bonus [value] attribute*\*\*\

the "value" atribute lets you assing a value when selected [taking both [name] and[id] atributes. If [value] is not specified it will return "on" as value when selected. (NOT usefull when you have multiple options [with one common [name]) 


Definition and Usage
The value attribute specifies the value of an <input> element.

https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_value.asp

The value attribute is used differently for different input types:

For "button", "reset", and "submit" - it defines the text on the button
For "text", "password", and "hidden" - it defines the initial (default) value of the input field
For "checkbox", "radio", "image" - it defines the value associated with the input (this is also the value that is sent on submit)
Note: The value attribute cannot be used with <input type="file">.


Step 31

Moving on to the final fieldset. What if you wanted to allow a user to upload a profile picture?

Well, the input type file allows just that. Add a label with the text Upload a profile picture: , and nest an input accepting a file upload.

<input type="file">

HTML <input> accept Attribute

Definition and Usage
The accept attribute specifies a filter for what file types the user can pick from the file input dialog box.

Note: The accept attribute can only be used with <input type="file">.

Tip: Do not use this attribute as a validation tool. File uploads should be validated on the server.



Step 31Passed

Moving on to the final fieldset. What if you wanted to allow a user to upload a profile picture?

Well, the input type file allows just that. Add a label with the text Upload a profile picture: , and nest an input accepting a file upload.



	<fieldset>
        	<label>	Upload a profile picture: <input type="file" />
		</label>
     	</fieldset>

Step 32
Add another label after the first, with the text Input your age (years): . Then, nest an input with the type of number.

Next, add a min attribute to the input with a value of 13 because users under the age of 13 should not register. Also, users probably will not be over the age of 120; add a max attribute with a value of 120.

Now, if someone tries to submit the form with values outside of the range, a warning will appear, and the form will not submit.



<fieldset>
        
        <label>Upload a profile picture: <input type="file" /> 
	</label>
        <label>Input your age (years): <input type="number" min ="13" max="120">

The select element is a container for a group of option elements, 
and the option element acts as a label for each dropdown option. 
Both elements require closing tags.



Definition and Usage

The <select> element is used to create a drop-down list.

The <select> element is most often used in a form, to collect user input.

The name attribute is needed to reference the form data after the form is submitted 
(if you omit the name attribute, no data from the drop-down list will be submitted).

The id attribute is needed to associate the drop-down list with a label.

The <option> tags inside the <select> element define the available options in the drop-down list.

Tip: Always add the <label> tag for best accessibility practices!

Step 33

Adding a dropdown to the form is easy with the select element. The select element is a container for a group of option elements, and the option element acts as a label for each dropdown option. Both elements require closing tags.

Start by adding a select element below the two label elements. Then nest 5 option elements within the select element.

Step 34
Nest the select element (with its option elements) within a label element with the text How did you hear about us?. The text should come before the select element.


	<fieldset>
		<label>Upload a profile picture: <input type="file" />
		</label>
		<label>Input your age (years): <input type="number" min="13" max="120" />
		</label>
		<label>How did you hear about us?
			<select>            
				<option></option>
				<option></option>
				<option></option>
				<option></option>
				<option></option>
			</select>
		</label>
	</fieldset>


Step 35

The dropdown options are currently empty. To give them content, add the following text to each subsequent option element:

(select one) /*The 1st element (as far i know) is visible thus setting the instruction there*/
freeCodeCamp News
freeCodeCamp YouTube Channel
freeCodeCamp Forum
Other



	<fieldset>
		<label>Upload a profile picture: <input type="file" />
		</label>
		<label>Input your age (years): <input type="number" min="13" max="120" />
		</label>
		<label>How did you hear about us?
			<select>            
				<option>(select one)</option>
				<option>freeCodeCamp News</option>
				<option>freeCodeCamp YouTube Channel</option>
				<option>freeCodeCamp Forum</option>
				<option>Other</option>
			</select>
		</label>
	</fieldset>



	************* Display box lengh**************
	*					    *
	* the longer text chain in the option group *
	* determines the leght of the dropdown box  *
	*					    *

Step 36

Submitting the form with an option selected would not send a useful value to the server. As such, each option needs to be given a value attribute. Without which, the text content of the option will be submitted to the server.

Give the first option a value of "", and the subsequent option elements value attributes from 1 to 4.

				option element <option></option>
	|-----------------------------------////\\\\----------------------------|


Definition and Usage

The <option> tag defines an option in a select list.

<option> elements go inside a <select>, <optgroup>, or <datalist> element.

Note: The <option> tag can be used without any attributes, but you usually need the value attribute, which indicates what is sent to the server on form submission.

Tip: If you have a long list of options, you can group related options within the <optgroup> tag.

============> HTML <option> "value" Attribute <=================

https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_option_value.asp


Definition and Usage
The value attribute specifies the value to be sent to a server when a form is submitted.

The content between the opening <option> and closing </option> tags is what the browsers will display in a drop-down list. However, the value of the value attribute is what will be sent to the server when a form is submitted.

Note: If the value attribute is not specified, the content will be passed as a value instead.

Step 36

Submitting the form with an option selected would not send a useful value to the server. As such, each option needs to be given a value attribute. Without which, the text content of the option will be submitted to the server.

Give the first option a value of "", and the subsequent option elements value attributes from 1 to 4.

the first value of "" is set that way so no value or an empty value is pased to the server side 

as ===> "Note: If the value attribute is not specified, the content will be passed as a value instead"


	<label>How did you hear about us?
        	<select>
			<option value= "">(select one)</option>
			<option value="1">freeCodeCamp News</option>
			<option value="2">freeCodeCamp YouTube Channel</option>
			<option value="3">freeCodeCamp Forum</option>
			<option value="4">Other</option>
		</select>

				text area element <textarea></textarea>
	|-----------------------------------////\\\\----------------------------|

Step 37

The textarea element acts like an input element of type text, but comes with the added benefit of being able to receive multi-line text, and an initial number of text rows and columns.


Users will be able to register with a bio. Add a label with the text Provide a bio: at the end of the fieldset. Add a textarea element inside the label element. Note that the textarea requires a closing tag.


Definition and Usage
The <textarea> tag defines a multi-line text input control.

The <textarea> element is often used in a form, to collect user inputs like comments or reviews.

A text area can hold an unlimited number of characters, and the text renders in a fixed-width font (usually Courier).

The size of a text area is specified by the cols and rows attributes (or with CSS).

The name attribute is needed to reference the form data after the form is submitted (if you omit the name attribute, no data from the text area will be submitted).

The id attribute is needed to associate the text area with a label. 

Tip: Always add the <label> tag for best accessibility practices!

Example
A multi-line text input control (text area):

<label for="w3review">Review of W3Schools:</label>

<textarea id="w3review" name="w3review" rows="4" cols="50">
At w3schools.com you will learn how to make a website. They offer free tutorials in all web development technologies.
</textarea>




Step 39
The textarea appears too small. To give it an initial size, you can add the rows and cols attributes.

Add an initial size of 3 rows and 30 columns.


Step 40
To give Campers an idea of what to put in their bio, the placeholder attribute is used. The placeholder accepts a text value, which is displayed until the user starts typing.

Give the textarea a placeholder of I like coding on the beach....


Step 41
With form submissions, it is useful, and good practice, to provide each submittable element with a name attribute. This attribute is used to identify the element in the form submission.

Give each submittable element a unique name attribute of your choosing, except for the two radio inputs.


********************************
HTML <textarea> name Attribute *

Definition and Usage
The name attribute specifies a name for a text area.

The name attribute is used to reference elements in a JavaScript, or to reference form data after a form is submitted.


Step 41
With form submissions, it is useful, and good practice, to provide each submittable element with a name attribute. This attribute is used to identify the element in the form submission.

Give each submittable element a unique name attribute of your choosing, except for the two radio inputs.


Step 42
The HTML for the registration form is finished. Now, you can spruce it up a bit.

Start by changing the font to Tahoma, and the font size to 16px in the body.
